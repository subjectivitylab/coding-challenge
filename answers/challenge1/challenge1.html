                <p><strong>Welcome to the experiment!</strong><br><br>
                    In this study, you'll see two squares in each trial: one white and one with a different color. Your task is to select the side where the white square appears. If the white square appears on the <strong>left</strong>, press <strong>"L"</strong> on your keyboard; it if appears on the <strong>right</strong>, then press <strong>"R"</strong> on your keyboard.
