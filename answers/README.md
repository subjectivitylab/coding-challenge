# READ BEFORE OPENING THESE FILES

I've provided code answering the challenges so that you can compare your code to mine. There are many acceptable ways of achieving the same goals, so I wouldn't be surprised if you found a better way of doing it or even mistakes. 

Another function of posting these files is in case you get seriously stuck. You could take a quick look at the code and try to figure out how something is done or why your code isn't working.

CAUTION: Do not use these files to simply copy my code into yours without understanding what the code is doing. You simply won't learn to code if you do this.
