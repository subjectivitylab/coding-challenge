# WARNING: READ BEFORE OPENING THESE FILES

Here I provide code answering the challenges so that you can compare your code to mine once you're done. There are many acceptable ways of achieving the same goals, so I wouldn't be surprised if you found a better way of doing it (I bet you can even find mistakes in my code!). 

Another function of posting these files is that, if you get seriously stuck, you can read the code and be able to move on. You could take a quick look at a portion of the code and try to figure out how something is done or why your code isn't working.

**CAUTION: Do not use these files to simply copy my code into yours without understanding what the code is doingâ€”otherwise you won't really be learning. When you're leading your own experiments, there won't be a pre-coded answer to rely on.**
