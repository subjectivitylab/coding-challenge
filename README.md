# HTML/CSS/JavaScript Coding Challenge for Creating Online Experiments
Quick guide for creating your first online experiment 

Hi, Jorge here. This GitHub project contains a series of coding "challenges" that will help you learn or assess your knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript basics for creating online experiments. 

The main tool we use in the lab to run online experiments is a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (not to be confused with Java!). While technically these are three different languages, they are often used together to create propertly formatted, flexible, dynamic websites. Lots of the internet runs (solely) on HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and this is 99% of what we need to run our experiments. 

Coding can be fun and the basics are often relatively easy to learn. I've found that the best way to learn (or test whether you know a language) is by trying to solve a real challenge. This is in contrast with, say, taking a coding course. I think those are extremely useful, they may give you a better overall understanding of coding in general and of the language you're learning in particular. To some extent you'll need to learn the basics by following some kind of online tutorial or by taking a class. But I think that to get to the point where you can code for running experiments you eventually need to actually try it (a class may not teach you everything you need to code a particular experiment, and it may teach you other things that—while useful—are not needed for running experiments.

In the spirit of this approach to coding, in this GitHub project you'll find three coding "challenges" with different difficulty degrees: challenge 1 is easier than challege 2 which is easier than challenge 3. Depending on your current coding skills, you may approach the challenges differently.

## You already know (to some degree) how to code in HTML/JS/CSS 

If you already know how to code using these languages, you could think of the challenges as a kind of "placement" excercise. If you solve all the three challenges quickly and easy, you're probably ready to go ahead and try out coding a real experiment with the lab. If you finished them all but it was hard, you probably are ready to code experiments too, but you'll need to pick up some new tricks/practice more to get to a comfortable and efficient level. If you solved at least one problem, but struggled with one or two challenges, you probably just need a bit more time to learn and practice more, keep going!

## You already know how to code in another progamming language

Transfering your skills from another language (e.g. Python, MatLab) to HTML/CSS/JavaScript is probably easier than learning how to program for the first time. I'd recommend looking for tutorials where you can learn the basic syntax of HTML/CSS/JavaScript and perhaps even tutorials specifically targeted for people switching from the language you know to HTML/JS/CSS. Once you feel comfortable with the new syntax, try solving the three challenges. Depending on how many, how fast you can solve you may be ready for coding online experiments or you may need to keep working a bit more on learning these new languages. 

## You've never programmed 

Fear not! Learning how to program can be really fun, extremely useful, and actually [pretty cool](https://twitter.com/frankefoster/status/1443982309443600384)! Although challenges 1-3 are supposed to increase in difficulty, for you, challenge 1 will be the most difficult and time consuming. Think of it like this: reading Harry Potter is easier than reading Shakespeare. Sure. But only if you already speak English! The effort required to learn enough English to understand Harry Potter is likely larger than the effort required to move from Harry Potter to Shakespeare. So, be patient! The learning curve might be a bit slow at the beginning (it may seem to you that you don't even know where to begin!), but once you get it, it'll just be a matter of practice. Challenges 2 and 3 will be, in a way, easier.

## General adivce

Google.Is.Your.Friend. You can (and forever will) google your way through coding. There are (probably literally) millions of resources out there. Even experienced coders google things all the time (from the most basic syntax questions to the most difficult problems). Google how to do things, find tutorials for your level of skill. And don't feel that you need to know everything about the language from a theoretical point of view before actually trying to code. Just go for it. You won't break anything :)

Good luck and have fun programming!
